## Get Started with Eventique

Eventique provides a seamless way to enhance communication between your server and React Native client applications. With the `eventique-push` SDK for the server side and the `react-native-eventique` module for the client side, you can push actions to your app in real-time without the need for constant polling.

### Setting Up `eventique-push`

1. **Install the package:**

   ```bash
   npm install eventique-push
   ```

2. **Initialize the SDK:**

   ```javascript
   const EventiquePush = require('eventique-push');

   const eventique = new EventiquePush({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
   ```

3. **Push an action:**

   ```javascript
   eventique.push({ deviceId: 'device-id', action: 'remove_cart' })
     .then(response => {
       console.log('Action pushed successfully:', response);
     })
     .catch(error => {
       console.error('Error pushing action:', error);
     });
   ```

### Setting Up `react-native-eventique`

1. **Install the package:**

   ```bash
   npm install react-native-eventique
   ```

2. **Link the library:**

   For React Native 0.60 and above, auto-linking should take care of the link process. For older versions, you'll need to manually link the library:

   ```bash
   react-native link react-native-eventique
   ```

3. **Listen for actions in your app:**

   In your React Native app, import the module and start listening for actions:

   ```javascript
   import { useEventiQueListener } from 'react-native-eventique';

    const [message, isConnected] = useEventiQueListener();

    // message is the action you sent on your server
   ```
